# Flask Login App with Role Management
This project is a Flask-based web application that implements user authentication, role management, and efficient data management.
It allows users to register and log in, with self-registering users being assigned the “Normal” role by default.
An admin user can access an exclusive admin panel to view all registered users, change user roles, or delete user accounts.
The project also emphasises proper data management practices by utilising Flask-SQLAlchemy for seamless database integration and schema management.
