# Flask Login App with Role Management
This project is a Flask-based web application that implements user authentication and role management.
It allows users to register and log in, with self-registering users being assigned the “Normal” role by default.
An admin user can access an exclusive admin panel to view all registered users, change user roles, or delete user accounts.
